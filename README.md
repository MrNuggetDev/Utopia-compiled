Source code for my food chain simulator, which I demonstrated in this YouTube video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy9N48udcdc

Note: I used Processing 4 to make this simulator. Download Processing here! https://processing.org/download

Controls: Press WASD + Space to move around. Press 'C' to have the camera start following the highlighted creature! (The one blinking white that is nearest to you.)
